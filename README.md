# Five-in-a-row

Gomoku also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It can be played using the 15×15 board[1] or the 19×19 board.[2] Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.

In my implementation board size being chosen by players at the start of the game, and instead of different colours onboard for each player, the X and O are used for differentiating between players.
